features:
  - Add oslo.messaging transport_url parameters via puppet-oslo resource
deprecations:
  - For the guestagent, control_exchange moved to trove class definition
    as it is intrinsic to default messaging configuration. It can no longer
    be set via the guestagent class and will be removed in a future release.
